# Trinita
This piece is simply based on this little bit of code

```
(x ^ y) % 3
```

then rearanged, and limited to the circles. This is just plain js, html, css with the use of the canvas.

You can see it online here : https://sthor.github.io/XORcircles/
and play with some parameters : 

```
    canvas.settings={
        cellWidth:1,
        radius:150,
        modulo:3
    };canvas.drawStuff();
```
